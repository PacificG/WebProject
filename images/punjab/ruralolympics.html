                   <p class='paragraph'>Every winter, Kila Raipur, a village in Punjab that is about 19 kms from Ludhiana, hosts Indiaâ€™s one-of-its kind Rural Olympics, formally called Kila Raipur Sports Festival.<br><br>

The sports festival, which is a four-day affair, was first started by Inder Singh Grewal, a noted philanthropist, in 1933. The main reason for starting this tournament was to give an opportunity to the farmers of the village to test their stamina and strength.<br><br>

This tournament features participants from different age groups. There is a race organised especially for senior citizens. Local farmers also try their luck in this competition along with professional athletes.<br><br>

The main attraction of the tournament is the bullock cart race. But this year, due to new regulations by the Animal Welfare Board, the bullocks were replaced by horses.
