Nestled amidst the foothills of the Garhwal Himalayan ranges, Mussoorie, also known as Queen of The Hills, stands at an altitude of 7000 feet above sea level, and has a cool, pleasant climate throughout the year. The pristine, natural beauty of Mussoorie makes it a very popular choice of holiday for honeymooners. If you want to enjoy the beautiful sight of the rolling green slopes juxtaposed with the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, Mussoorie is the place for you to be.</p>
