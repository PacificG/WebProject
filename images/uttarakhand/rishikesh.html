                   <p class='paragraph'>Located in the foothills of the Himalayas along the convergence of Ganga and Chandrabhaga River, Rishikesh (also called as Hrishikesh) is known for its adventure activities, ancient temples, popular cafes and as the "Yoga Capital of the World". With whitewater rafting industry growing and varied camping and cafe spots springing up, Rishikesh has grown immensely as a favourite, catering to people with different needs.<br>

Over the years, the tranquil town has become extremely popular as the top spiritual destination in the world, especially after the Beatles association with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi here in the late '60s. As it lies on the holy banks of river Ganga, Rishikesh has been a hub of Sadhus (saints) with numerous ashrams teaching spirituality, yoga, meditation and Ayurveda springing up, the most popular of which is the Beatles Ashram.
